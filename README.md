Developing a coding project that manages the purchase and reservation of tickets for their clients. Customers may use it to look up and choose flights,Â and buy tickets online.The system normally has a database that contains data about flights, timetables, availability, prices, and customer information. When a customer searches for a flight, the database is searched for available flights depending on the client's search settings, such as the destination, departure date, and chosen class. The system then shows a list of accessible flights together with their associated prices and itineraries.
