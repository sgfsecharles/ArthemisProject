# Airline Ticketing Reservation
Developing a coding project that manages the purchase and reservation of tickets for their clients. Customers may use it to look up and choose flights,Â and buy tickets online.The system normally has a database that contains data about flights, timetables, availability, prices, and customer information. When a customer searches for a flight, the database is searched for available flights depending on the client's search settings, such as the destination, departure date, and chosen class. The system then shows a list of accessible flights together with their associated prices and itineraries. The system asks the user to provide their name, contact information, and payment information after they have chosen a flight. An electronic ticket is issued when the system has verified the payment information and confirmed the reservation. Additionally, the system enables users to monitor flight status, change or cancel reservations.
